                    <h4><i>1.Plough (also 'plow')</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        The plough is primarily designed to prepare the ground for cultivation by turning it over, thus burying the weeds and loosening the earth. 
                    </p>
                     <h4><i>2.Harrow </i></h4>
                     <p>
                      The harrow was necessary to smoothen the soil in areas where the soil remained rough. Harrows are also used to uproot weeds, aerate the soil, and cover seeds. 
                     </p>
                     <h4><i>3.Seed Driller </i></h4>
                     <p>Seed drill was an innovation that allowed seeds to be easily planted deep into the earth instead of on top where the majority were washed away or otherwise lost. The machine was pulled by horses and consisted of rotating drills or runners that planted seeds at a set depth. </p>
                     <h4><i>4.Horse Hoe</i></h4>
<p>It is horse-drawn machine which loosened the soil and killed weeds.</p>
                         <h4><i>5.Reaper</i></h4>
                         <p>
                            The first reapers cut the standing grain and, with a revolving reel, sweeping it onto a platform from which it was raked off into piles by a man walking alongside. The reaper could thus harvest more grain than five men using the earlier cradles.   
                        </p>
                     <h4><i>6.Threshing Machines</i></h4>
<p>Prior to the threshing machines farmers used an implement called 'flail' to simply beat the grain with sticks or ropes to knock the seeds from the stalks. But this was a back-breaking work and was of low productivity. Threshing machines were designed for rapidly removing the husks from grain</p>
<h4><i>7.Tractor</i></h4>
<p>Tractor is a vehicle particularly crafted to exert traction at slow speeds, for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery used in agriculture. The versatility of tractor is with respect to its attachments that it supports. The more the options for connecting attachments to the tractor, the higher is the cost. The most common tractor attachments include front end loaders, mowers, box blades, spreaders, tillers, plows, trailers and backhoes for plowing, tilling, disking, harrowing, planting, and similar tasks.  </p>
                     <h4><i>8.Irrigation Technology</i></h4>
                     <p>Water is undoubtedly the sine qua non for all irrigation activities, worldwide. Particularly in India, an unpredictable monsoon coupled with an increasing demand for food production (at the self-sustenance as well as commercial levels) has induced an imperative need for irrigation options other than those that are either extremely laborious and time consuming or simply too expensive for the small and marginal farmer. </p>
                     <h4><i>9.Treadle Pump</i></h4>
<p>It is a foot operated water lifting device that can irrigate small plots of land of small holders in regions that have higher water table (not deeper than 25 feet). A treadle pump is a low cost system, simple in design and easily manageable; it appropriately answers the irrigation need for the small farmers.
                       </p>

                     <h4><i>10.Drop Irrigation Technology</i></h4>
                    <p> Drip irrigation is a water-saving technology which enables slow and regular application of water directly to the roots of the plants through a network of economically designed plastic pipes and low discharge emitters. It maximizes crop productivity through increase in the crop yield and also the area for cultivation, and protects the environment through conserving soil, water and fertilizer resources, thus increasing the farmer income. Currently, this is being promoted by the Government of India in the form of kits in the water scarce regions in India. They are:    

<p>A.Frees the farmer from the limitations of rain fed farming </p>
<p>B.Raises the capacity of the farmer to grow crops in both winter and summer </p>
<p>C.Leads to land augmentation - With the use of the above mentioned technologies the farmers can cultivate all the year round thus increasing their cropping intensity to 200-300% and never leave their land fallow </p>
<p>D.Easy to use.</p>
