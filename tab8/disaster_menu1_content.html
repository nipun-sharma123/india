                 <p>   Earthquakes happen suddenly and no one could exactly predict when it can happen that is why when earthquakes occur, several lives are lost and properties are damaged. The only way by which people could be safe is to take precautionary measures. Even before the earthquake you should always be prepared in order to minimize problems.</p>

<p>Here are some of the precautionary measures before, during and after the earthquake.</p>

<p><b>What to do before the earthquake:</b></p>

<p>1.Be cautious and ready to face dangers that comes your way. Try to be calm when danger comes so that you can deal with problems that the earthquake brings.</p>
 <p>2.Attend earthquake drills. Schools conduct earthquake drills for students so that they will know what to do in case of earthquake. People are also taught how to take precautionary measures before, during and after an earthquake.   To help you get to know about earthquakes more, try to read books or magazines that discuss about earthquakes.</p>
<p>3.Be prepared for first aid kits. It is also important to be prepared with flashlights, some batteries, knife, plies, hammer or other important tools. Put these things in a box and put it in a convenient place where you can grab it if earthquake occurs. These things will be very useful in cases of emergency,
Remove all heavy objects on top of cabinets and put them at the bottom of the cabinets.</p>
<p>4.Fasten all appliances to the walls and floor so that they will be secured</p>
<p><b>What to do during the earthquake:</b></p>

 <p>1.Do not panic. If there are kids, gather them together and stay with them.  Kids panic easily so it is important for you to be with them to tell them what and what not to do.</p>
 <p>2.Seek cover under strong tables, chairs and beds. </p>
 <p>3.If you are outdoors, stay away from tall buildings and walls.</p>
<p> 4.Avoid staying near electric posts.</p>
<p>5.Lay down on the ground.</p>
 <p>6.Use flashlights instead of open flames because it might create a spark that could cause fire if there is gas leak.</p>
 <p>7.Ran outside the house if you have time.</p>
 <br></br>
<p><b>What to do after the earthquake:</b></p>

<p>1.Check every member of the family. If someone is hurt, apply first aid.</p>
