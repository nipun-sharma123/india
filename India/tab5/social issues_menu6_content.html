                        Since the 1950s, the Indian government and non-governmental organisations have initiated several programmes to alleviate poverty, including subsidising food and other necessities, increased access to loans, improving agricultural techniques and price supports, and promoting education and family planning. These measures have helped eliminate famines, cut absolute poverty levels by more than half, and reduced illiteracy and malnutrition.
                        Although the Indian economy has grown steadily over the last two decades, its growth has been uneven when comparing social groups, economic groups, geographic regions, and rural and urban areas
                        <br><b>Govt. Action:</b>Since the early 1950s, Indian government initiated various schemes to help the poor attain self-sufficiency in food production. These have included ration cards and price controls over the supply of basic commodities, particularly food at controlled prices, available throughout the country. These efforts prevented famines, but did little to eliminate or reduce poverty in rural or urban areas between 1950 and 1980.
                        The social welfare programs such as <b>Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)</b> and <b>Midday Meal Scheme</b> in Government Schools are helping to reduce rural poverty gap (intensity of rural poverty), seasonal poverty, but not overall poverty.
