                       Dowry deaths are deaths of young women who are murdered or driven to suicide by continuous harassment and torture by husbands and in-laws in an effort to extort an increased dowry.
                        Dowry death is considered one of the many categories of violence against women, alongside rape, bride burning, eve teasing, and acid throwing.
                        Most dowry deaths occur when the young woman, unable to bear the harassment and torture, commits suicide. Most of these suicides are by hanging, poisoning or by fire. Sometimes the woman is killed by setting herself on fire; this is known as "bride burning", and sometimes disguised as suicide or accident. 
                        <br><b>Govt. Action:</b>Indian women's rights activists campaigned for more than 40 years to contain dowry deaths, such as the <b>Dowry Prohibition Act</b> 1961 and the more stringent Section 498a of IPC(enacted in 1983). Using the <b>Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 (PWDVA)</b> implemented in 2006, a woman can put a stop to the dowry harassment by approaching a domestic violence protection officer.
