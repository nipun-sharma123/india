                        Domestic violence is currently defined in India by the Protection of Women from <b>Domestic Violence Act of 2005</b>. According to Section 3 of the Act, â€œany act, omission or commission or conduct of the respondent shall constitute domestic violence in case it - (a) harms or injures or endangers the health, safety, life, limb or well-being, whether mental or physical, of the aggrieved person or tends to do so and includes causing physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal and emotional abuse and economic abuse; or (b) harasses, harms, injures or endangers the aggrieved person with a view to coerce her or any other person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any dowry or other property or valuable security; or (c) has the effect of threatening the aggrieved person or any person related to her by any conduct mentioned in clause (a) or clause (b); or (d) otherwise injures or causes harm, whether physical or mental, to the aggrieved person.Domestic violence in India is endemic. Around 70% of women in India are victims of domestic violence, for women and child development.
                        <br>National Crime Records Bureau reveal that a crime against a woman is committed every three minutes, a woman is raped every 29 minutes, a dowry death occurs every 77 minutes, and one case of cruelty committed by either the husband or relative of the husband occurs every nine minutes.This all occurs despite the fact that women in India are legally protected from domestic abuse under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.
                        The <b>Domestic Violence Act of 2005</b> provides victims of abuse with a means for practical remedy through prosecution.
                        The Domestic Violence Act of 2005 has been reportedly used against men in some cases, though the vast majority of cases involve abuse of a woman.
