                           <br><b><u>1.Diarrhoea:</u></b> is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. 
                          
                           <br><b>Prevention and cure :</b>Prevention of infectious diarrhea is by improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing. Breastfeeding for at least six months is also recommended as is vaccination against rotavirus. Oral rehydration solution (ORS), which is clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar, along with zinc tablets are the treatments of choice When people have diarrhea it is recommended that they continue to eat healthy food and babies continue to be breastfeed.

                          <br><b><u>2.Dengue:</u></b> viral infection which is carried by mosquitoes and results into fever, joint pain, body aches and rash.  Dengue is mostly fond to occur in India during the monsoon season.<br><b>Prevention and cure :</b><br>it is very unfortunate that still today there is no drugs available in medical science to prevent the virus. Since it is transmitted via mosquitoes, one should wear a strong insect repellent which contains strong DEET. This precaution helps in preventing getting bitten.One can avoid use of perfume and after shave lotion and wear lose and light color dress.
                          <br><b><u>3.Malaria:</u></b>The signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection;[8] however, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention.Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptomsThe presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions transmitted by mosquito. Prevalent during monsoon. 
                          
                           <br><b>Prevention and cure :</b>preventive measures against mosquito bites.
 an anti-malarial drug such as mefloquine, doxycycline or atovaquone/Proguanil.

                          <br><b><u>4.Typhoid:</u></b>symptoms are fever (usually between 1030F- 1040F), rashes (flat, rose-coloured spots), vomiting, loss of appetite, headaches, general fatigue. In severe cases one may suffer from intestinal perforations or internal bleeding, diarrhoea or constipation.

                          <br><b>Prevention and cure :</b><br>Once diagnosed a patient is treated with antibiotics.
                          <br>• Do not eat food cooked on the road side. This is because it is very difficult to judge the water source they use and the cleanliness of the food handler.
                          <br>• Do not have ice or popsicles prepared locally. Since the water source and cleanliness of the manufacturing facility is unknown, it is best avoided.
                          <br>• Do not eat fruits and raw vegetables that have been precut.
                          <br>• One must make sure they wash their hands well before cooking a meal or eating.
                          <br>• Always drink either bottled water or boiled water. 

                          <br><b><u>5.Tuberculosis:</u></b>The classic symptoms of active TB infection are a chronic cough with blood-tinged sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss
                           When people with active pulmonary TB cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or spit, they expel infectious  droplets which may transmit the disease, since the infectious dose of tuberculosis is very small.

                           <br><b>Prevention and cure :</b>The only available vaccine  is bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG).In children it decreases the risk of getting the infection by 20% and the risk of infection turning into disease by nearly 60%.
                            The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months.

                          <br><b><u>6.HIV/AIDS:</u></b>Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a disease spectrum of the human immune system caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).The term HIV/AIDS represents the entire range of the infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus. During the initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems. The late symptoms of the infection are referred to as AIDS.HIV is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse contaminated blood transfusions,hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV<br><b>Prevention and cure :</b><br>:Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through safe sex and needle-exchange programs, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy.
